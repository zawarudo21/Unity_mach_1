My game takes inspiration from one of my favourite characters in overwatch : Mcree (later renamed to cassidy), who had action, where if you looked at enemies for a certain time and attacked they would basically die. My game's premise is that balloons(basically spheres) are flying towards you randomly, at different speeds and if you look at them for a certain time, they become "poppable", which is indicated by the change in color of the balloon. The idea is that when the user presses the screen/mouse, all balloons which are poppable and currently in camera view, get popped. You receive one point for each balloon popped. There is a timer (30 seconds) after which the game ends. All in game objects stop moving and the game over screen appears. I believe the application I made is a game for several reasons. Mechanically, it is bound by a set of rules ( only poppable ballons are popped, user cannot move, there is only one aciton possible by the user), it has an end condition (game ends after 30 seconds), and has some sort of interactive element ( touchscreen / mouse input, but more importantly, where the player decides to view the camera. It also has a competitive element, which is to score the most points in a certain time frame. The balloons also have an audiosource attached which make a pop sound when they are popped (link provided below). While it is not the most immersive, particles have been added to give the feeling that wind is blowing towards the camera. There is a puzzle solving aspect, of deciding which area you should choose to look at such that it will maximize the points you get, which requires quick thinking on the users part. The user can look at the UI to know their current points and time remaining. 
I have included two apk's in the builds folder. The "target" build is for the app which was developed by following step 5 of the assignment. The other build is for the game I have described above. I looked at a few youtube tutorials and the unity documentation to make this project. The only assets I used was the pop sounds for the balloons. Link to all of them below
